# Time_Series_Clustering

This repo contains updated analytical part of my postgraduate thesis "Analysis of leasing companies using data clustering methods". The aim of this analysis was to examine whether there were such close similarities between the companies affiliated in the Polish Leasing Association in the years 2003 â€“ 2022 that it was possible to group these companies on the basis of the assets they financed.

The analysis was performed using various time series clustering methods. The purpose of cluster analysis (clustering) is to assign objects to groups (clusters) in such a way that the objects in a given group are as similar to each other as possible and, at the same time, the least similar to objects from other clusters. In other words, the goal is to divide the objects into homogeneous and well-separated groups. The analysis used the dtwclust package, which provides a wide range of data clustering methods.

objects_list.xlsx contains dictionary of leased objects' code names in R files.
leasing_dataset.csv contains dataset.
Leasing.Rproj, Leasing_analysis.R and Leasing_functions.R contain all R scripts required to run this analysis.
